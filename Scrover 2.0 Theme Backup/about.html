   <h2>What is Scrover?</h2>
   <p>Scrover is not JUST an alternative to Scratch, it's the very first revival planning to be based on Scratch 1.4 or Scratch 2.0.</p>
   <p>The idea has been based on YouTube, ROBLOX and other old site revivals. With Scrover, you can code animations, games and stories on the web!</p>
   <p>We are also planning for Scrover to be aimed for all ages, but we don't know yet.</p>
   <p>P.S., The creation of Scrover is not owned by the Scratch Team, it is owned by fan users working together to make it to life!</p>

   <p>The full creation of Scrover is unkown, since we are waiting for Ruffle to support most things, and Actionscript is needed to run the Scrover Editor.</p>
